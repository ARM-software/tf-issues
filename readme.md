ARM Trusted Firmware Issue Tracker
==================================

As of April 2019 the [arm-trusted-firmware] project has relocated as a Github project to the TrustedFirmware.org [Trusted Firmware A] project. The Github project repository is now a read-only mirror of the TrustedFirmware.org project repository.

This repository was solely for the purpose of creating and tracking an [issue] in the [ARM Trusted Firmware] project repository and now contains a historic record of those issues.

A new [Task/Issue] Workbook on the TrustedFirmware.org project is the replacement issue tracker system.

Please follow these guidelines for using the issue tracker:

*   If you have a question, create an [Task/Issue] and apply the "question" label.
    If the question is directed at an individual, then assign them to the
    issue. If the question is directed at an organization (e.g. ARM), please
    say so in the description.
*   If you identify a bug, create an [Task/Issue] and apply the "bug" label. Clearly
    describe the problem, including steps to reproduce.
*   Before starting work on the main repository, create an [Task/Issue] for your
    work, if one does not already exist. This gives everyone visibility of
    your work and helps others avoid working on something similar.
    *   For bugs, apply the "bug" label if it's not already present.
    *   For enhancements, apply the "enhancement" label and clearly describe
        how you intend to implement the change.
    *   Assign yourself to the issue using the edit dialog.
*   When the issue has been fixed in the main repository, close the issue. 
*   Feel free to comment on any issues with relevant information.

Note there is not fine-grained access control on the [Task/Issue] workbook so please do
not edit/close other people's issues without their permission.

The TrustedFirmware.org [Dashboard] provides access to all facilities including source code, documentation, Gerrit review for submitting changes, a wiki, an issue/task workboard/tracker as well as showing recent activity in the project. This dashboard also provides detailed contributing guidelines.
